' This file needs to be included in MPG.pgm if 
' an Npaq or Nservo is being used with the MPG.
' Each define below should be reviewed to ensure 
' the axis names match the system where the MPG
' is being used.

' Define the names of the axes present in your system by
' changing the second letter in each of the next six program lines, 
' Be sure to use the correct upper/lower case of the axis name.

' 	For Nservo this should be the name of the axis connected to the MPG
